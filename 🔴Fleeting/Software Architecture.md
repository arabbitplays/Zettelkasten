# Software Architecture

## Introduction

- A software architecture is 
	- the result of a set of design decisions
	- comprising the structure of the system 
		- with components
		- their relationships 
		- their mapping to execution environments
- questions to be answered by the decisions
	- how will the system be decomposed into subsystems
		- which are reusable?
	- what management and evolution strategy should be used
		- [[Model Driven Architecture]]

## Architecture Styles

- Modern OO systems are usually grouped in layers each consisting of one or more subsystems having a cohesive responsibility
	- higher levels call lower levels
