# Wave V - Guarantees under uncertainty

## Introduction

- definition of uncertainty in the SAS context
- details on quantitative verification

- uncertainty is a state that involves imperfect and/or unknown information
	- through physical measurements
	- underspecification of the problem or solution space
	- numerical approximations
	- non-determinism
- is applies to prediction of future events

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">aleatory uncertainty</mark> 
	- inherent uncertainty due to randomness of a phenomenon
	- for example in measurements
	- is irreducible
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">epistemic uncertainty</mark>
	- a lack of knowledge about the system
	- for example ambiguous or imprecise information about the requirements or the environment of the system
	- is reducible, as more information can help
