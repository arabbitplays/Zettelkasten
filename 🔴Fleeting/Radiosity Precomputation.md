# Radiosity Precomputation
## Introduction

- Solve the [[Rendering Equation]] under some assumptions to get some precomputed indirect lighting
- Only diffuse materials can be modeled and the precomputations saves the radiosity ([[Radiometry]]) for patches of area in the scene

## Derivation

- take the rendering equation, assubme a d
