# Model Quality

## Best Practices

- use inheritance and multiple inheritance to avoid repetition and factor out structures
	- never insert the same attribute or reference into two classes
- there should be a root element and every other element should be contained by exactly on other element
	- model should follow a tree structure
	- allows for clear responsibility of life cycle management
	- an element may have multiple possible containers
