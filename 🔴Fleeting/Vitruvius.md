- combines the synthetic and projective approaches to [[Model Views]]
- based on the SUM model introduced in [[Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM)]]

## Constructing a SUM

- the SUM Metamodel can be seen a a collection of [[Metamodel | metamodels]] and [[Model Transformations]] to construct different views from these metamodels

- creation process:
	- choose the Metamodels that should be used by the SUM
	- Specify the legacy views that are commonly needed
	- choose and specify the combined views espacialy needed by this system
