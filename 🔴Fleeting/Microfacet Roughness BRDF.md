# Microfacet Roughness BRDF

## Trowbridge-Reitz  Distribution

- $D(\omega_m)$ is the probability of a microfacet having its normal into the given direction
	- if both alphas are the same, the brdf is isotropic
- $G_1(\omega, \omega_m)$ ist the fraction of microfacets with normal $\omega_m$ that are visible from $\omega$
