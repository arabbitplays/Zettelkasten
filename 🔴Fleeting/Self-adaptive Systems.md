# Self-adaptive Systems

## Introduction

- self-adaptive systems are software systems that react to the environment with no or nearly no manual intervention

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">environment</mark> - how many users, hardware, other application on the same hardware, ...
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">managed systems</mark> - the main system, having the domain concepts
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">managing systems</mark> - the control system, getting high level goals and adapting the managed system to these goals through a feedback loop
- there are many different types of feedback loops 
	- most basic model is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">MAPE-K</mark> loop, 

## Waves of research

- the research in self adaptive systems can be structured into 7 waves
	- the 1. and 2. focuses on the fundamental principles of such systems
		- [[Wave I - Automating Tasks]], [[Wave II - Architecture-based Adaptation]]
	- the 3. and 4. focus on concrete aspects of the concrete realization of such systems
		- [[Wave III - Runtime Models]]
	- the 5. and 6. focus on uncertainties as a key driver for self-adaptation
		- [[Wave V - Guarantees under uncertainty]]
	- the 7. focuses on exploiting [[Machine Learning Index | ML]] to support different functions of the system
		- especially [[Explainable AI (XAI)]] is crucial here
