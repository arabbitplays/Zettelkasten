# Model Views

- different roles of a project look at a system from different viewpoints as models become to complex to be understood by one person
	- information is distributed in different heterogeneous models
	- information between different models becomes redundant or dependent on other models
	- when changes hit, these redundancies can lead to inconsistency which invalidates the whole model
