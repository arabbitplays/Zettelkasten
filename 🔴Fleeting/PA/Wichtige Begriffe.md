- CRCW Resolvement Strategies
	- Common - All writers have to agree
	- Arbitrary - Someone succeeds (not random, just not defined)
	- Priority - PE with smallest ID succeeds
	- Combine - All values are combined
- aCRQW models contention with concurrent write access
- Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) principle
- Work is how much is calculated $pT(p)$
- Span is the parallelizability $T_\infty = lim_{p\rightarrow \infty}T(p)$
- Absolute Speedup $S = T_{seq} / T(p)$ with the best sequential algo
- Efficiency $E = S /p$ with the  goal of $E \approx 1$
