# Image Difference Metrics

## Introduction

- The goal is to measure the (visible) differences between two images
- often used to measure the difference of a rendering algorithm ([[Monte Carlo Integration]]) to a reference image

## Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

- take the squared difference for each pixel, calculate the mean and take the root
$$\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N (a_i - b_i)Â²}$$
- the MSE includes the (squared) bias and the variance of the images
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">dominated by the big differences</mark>

## Relative RMSE (rRMSE)

- divide out the brightness of the reference pixel
	- make it not symmetric, because the reference is divided out, not the noisy pixel
- still dominated by big differences though the L2 difference

## Symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE)

$$SMAPE(x,y) = \frac{|x-y|}{|x|+|y|+\epsilon}$$
- the L1 difference tames the domination of outliers
- is symmetric again
- still doesn't tell the whole story as brightness normalisation is not the only feature of the [[Human Visual System (HVS)]]

## FLIP

- Perceptual based metric -> measure the visible difference, not the numerical 
- uses a perceptually uniform [[Color Spaces | Color Space]] and corrects for several perception effects
	- receptive fields  and contrast sensitivity
	- Hunt effect
- splits the error into a color error and a feature error (points and edges)
- backed by real experimental data regarding the color space and the error metric itself
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">current state of the art</mark>
