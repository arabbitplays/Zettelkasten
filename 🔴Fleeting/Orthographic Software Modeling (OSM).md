# Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM)

- all artifacts describing a system can be understood as [[Model Views]]
	- even program codes, as it has no information about for example the deployment
- Idea: all information is present in a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Single Underlying Model (SUM)</mark>, all views are generated from this model
	- information is displayed and manipulated only through specific views 
	- the underlying formalism is the SUM [[Metamodel]]


- In other engineering disciplines, orthograhpic projection is used for technical drawings
	- apply this in software engineering -> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orthographic Software Modeling (OSM)</mark>

- Basic principles of OSM
	- Dynamic View Generation
	- Dimension-based
