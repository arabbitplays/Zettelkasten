# Lambert's law

- The amount of light is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the light direction and the surface normal

- When the light source is directly over the surface, $A = A_1$ and the [[Radiometry | Irradiance]] of a point of the surface is $E = \Phi / A$ (when the light source has flux $Phi$)
- Else $A_2 = A / cos(\theta)$ and for a point on the surface the irradiance is $E = \Phi\ cos(\theta) / A$
