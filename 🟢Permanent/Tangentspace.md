# Tangentspace

- use for computations that happen on the surface of an object (for example [[Normal Transformations]])
- uses normal, tangent and bitangent at the position of the surface
	- normal is already needed for lighting computations
	- tangent can be calculated by surrounding normals
		- normally at load time of the model and then provided as another vertex attribute
	- bitangent is the cross of the normal and the tangent
		- direction is important for correct calculations
