# The P.A.R.A. Folderstructure


Defines 4 different folder categories:
- Projects
	- A series of steps linked to a final goal with a clear deadline
	- For example finishing a game prototype, developing a project plan, write a blog post
- Area of responsibility
	- a sphere of activity that has to be maintained over time
	- For example health, finance, travel, hobbies, productivity
- Ressource
	- Topic or theme of ongoing interest
	- For example music, gardening, habit formation
	- Contains the [[Zettelkasten]] as it contains everything that interests me
- Archive 
	- inactive items from the other three categories

- From top to bottom the categories become less actionable
