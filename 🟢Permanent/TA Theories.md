# TA Theories


- The practice of TA is very diverse, depending on the context, technology and actor being advised
	- Still needs a theoretical basis and to be comparable and assessable

- Characteristics of a good TA theory
	- Consistency -> can bring together the many different practical approaches
	- Conceptual reflection -> clear definition of terms (technology, consequence, ...)
	- Systematization -> classification of knowledge in a larger framework
	- Fruitfulness -> enables further development of concepts and methods to adapt to framework conditions
	- Support for practice -> evaluation of methods in specific contexts, knowledge transfer and systematic learning

- Determination of the [[knowledge interest]]
	- TA as policy advice - consequences of science and technology for political fields of action
		- Examine and analyze, evaluate and compare alternatives
		- Introducing new alternatives and possible consequences
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Thinking in alternatives</mark> increases the feeling for the best option and increases the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">reflexivity</mark> of decision-making processes 
	- Participatory TA (TA in public dialog) - expanding the criteria for considering and evaluating new technologies in a participatory manner, 
		- Include the interests of affected citizens and stakeholders, for example
		- Inclusion of different perspectives and affected parties, of values, attitudes, biographies and experiences, but also of local knowledge also increases reflexivity
	- TA in technology design - expanding classic efficiency criteria in design to include environmental compatibility or justice
		- Direct collaboration with engineers and designers for better exploration of technical design
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Common interest is to increase reflexivity in the design of scientific and technological change</mark>
	- The aim is to deal responsibly with results and consequences

## Conceptual dimensions

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Participation</mark> - Recognizing and evaluating consequences at an early stage
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Inclusion</mark> - Include many perspectives on the future
	- Very different in depth, expert TA also still takes place
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Complexity management </mark>- Limiting the scope of anticipation and inclusion
	- Central concept of relevance -> setting up a system of all relevant actors, influencing factors, values, ...
	- Determines the course of the project very significantly

## Objects of TA

- Neither technology nor the consequences of technology are direct objects
	- They do not yet exist, otherwise TA would not be necessary
	- Technology is no longer always a direct object (see the Internet, automatic decision making, ...)
- New technology is an object of TA if it has <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">meanings of social significance</mark>
	- Significance is usually attributed on the basis of assumed technological consequences

## Knowledge in the TA

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">System knowledge</mark> - Interrelationships in the system under consideration
	- Not only purely scientific, social (societal) aspects and e.g. environmental science and economic topics are also relevant
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orientation knowledge</mark> - Instructions for diagnoses, assessments and objectives
	- What is the direction of the required changes
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Action knowledge</mark> - knowledge about measures, strategies and instruments

- Orientation knowledge can be further subdivided:
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">future knowledge</mark> - anticipation, how will the system change in the future, what are the consequences of possible decisions
		- Directly linked to current ideas, expectations, etc. and can therefore become outdated
		- The most important variable is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">degree of expectability</mark> - how likely the future will actually be
		- In a social context, predictions can also influence the course of events
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Contextual knowledge</mark> - constellations, actors and their relationships, history, ...
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Normative orientation</mark> - goals, evaluation criteria, ethnic principles
