- Perceptual response to light of different wavelengths (spectrum $P$)
$$s = \int S(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda \ \ \ \ m = \int M(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda \ \ \ l = \int L(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda$$
- The ratio of s, m and l gives the perceived hue
- those are the [[Color Spaces#Color Matching Functions]] of the eye (LMS color space)
## Metamerism

- different spectra can look the same -> as long as $P(\lambda)$ produces the same response. $P(\lambda)$ produces the same response $(s,m,l)$
- this allows screens with 3 primary colors to recreate complex spectra
## Photometry

- Similar quantities as in [[radiometry]] but weighted by the brightness sensitivity curve
