# Human Visual System (HVS)

![[Pasted image 20241029120854.png | 400]]
- Perceptual response to light of different wavelengths (spectrum $P$)
$$s = \int S(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda \ \ \ \ m = \int M(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda \ \ \ l = \int L(\lambda)P(\lambda)d\lambda$$
- The ratio of s, m and l gives the perceived hue
- those are the [[Color Spaces#Color Matching Functions]] of the eye (LMS color space)
- perception of the HVS is not per pixel, but following a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">receptive field</mark>
	- this allows for the detection of points and edges
	- frequency of the perceived signal matters -> thus the distance to the object
- the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Hunt Effect</mark> describes that brighter colors appear more colorful
## Metamerism

- different spectra can look the same -> as long as $P(\lambda)$ produces the same response. $P(\lambda)$ produces the same response $(s,m,l)$
- this allows screens with 3 primary colors to recreate complex spectra
