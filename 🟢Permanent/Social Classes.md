# Social Classes

- Not classes in the Marxist sense
- Scheme according to John Goldthorpe:
- Dimension 1: Difficulty of monitoring
- How well can performance be measured, assembly line work vs. professorship
- Dimension 2: Specificity of human capital
- How important is it that this specific person does the work
		- Regardless of the skills required for the job

- Easy monitoring with low specificity enables classic “labor contracts,” the short-term exchange of labor for money
- Difficult monitoring and high specificity creates the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">principal agent problem</mark>, in which the employee has more information than the employer
	- Thus, a kind of trust must prevail
- Ensures longer-term contracts
