# Second Brain

- Creativity is not original -> Every idea you hear is interpreted, thus it is instantly your own
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The Capture Habit</mark> - Write down ideas, cool stuff and insights down, no matter is you see their usecase or if you think you are gonna remember them anyway
- Reusing ideas can help to get faster with stuff
