# Self-justifying Technology

- Investment in a technology is justified by the fact that it is better than a previous one
	- the “problem” with the earlier technology is that it is not already the better version
- Example HDTV: was only developed because it was promised that e.g. the sound quality would be better -> poor sound quality is only a problem because a better one was promised

- The vertical coupling of the [[Ideogram]] “technical progress” and earlier breakthroughs forces the actual realization of promises

- Combination of promises, self-justifying technology and translation into requirements creates self-fulfilling prophecies
	- Moore's Law that chip density doubles is another example
		- The industry evaluates its progress against this law and increases efforts if it is not fulfilled
