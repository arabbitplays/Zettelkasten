# Whitted Style Raytracing

- model all lights a single points
	- the light can be sampled with a single ray directly to the light source
- generate new ray into the perfect reflection direction (Reflection-Rays) and into the perfekt transmission direction according to [[Snells Law of Refraction]]
	- weigh both results with the fresnek value
