# Complex Numbers

## Introduction

An extension of the real numbers into the second dimension:
$$z = a + bi \in \mathbb{C};\ a,b\in \mathbb{R};\ i^2=-1$$
They can also be expressed as polar coordinates:
$$z = re^{i\phi} = r(cos(\phi) + isin(\phi))$$
So here, $z$ can be interpreted as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with distance $r$ to the origin and rotated by $\phi$ degrees
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">So multiplication with a normalised complex number is a rotation!</mark>
$$z*e^{i\theta} = re^{i(\phi + \theta)}$$

## Multiplication

- for computers more easy:
$$z_1z_2 = (a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+(ad-bc)i$$
- for humans more intuitive:
$$z_1z_2=r_1e^{i\phi_1}r_2e^{i\phi_2} = r_1r_2e^{i(\phi_1+\phi_2)}$$
