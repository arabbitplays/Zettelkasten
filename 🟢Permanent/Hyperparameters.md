# Hyperparameters

## Introduction

- All parameters that are not automatically optimised during learning
- [[Capacity]] of the model (degree of the polynomial, number of layers/neurons, etc.)
- Learning rate of [[Gradient Descent]]
	- Regularisation
- Activation function in neural networks

## Optimisation

- Division of data into an additional validation data set
- Testing of hyperparameters on this data set
- Prevents adjustment of hyperparameters to increase capacity and overfit test data
- Possible approaches
- Manual search
	- Try all possibilities (grid search)
- Random search
- Bayesian optimisation - After each experiment, the information content of further experiments is evaluated
