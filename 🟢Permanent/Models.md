# Models

## General Definition

1. Mapping Feature
	- Models are a representation of some natural or artificial original, maybe even another model
2. Reduction Feature
	- Models represent not all attributes of the original, but only those that seem relevant for the models creator and users
3. Pragmatic Feature
	- There is no one to one mapping between models and originals
	- Models are made for specific purposes, regarding a subject, time interval or operation
