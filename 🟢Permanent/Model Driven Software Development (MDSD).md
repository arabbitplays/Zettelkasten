# Model Driven Software Development (MDSD)

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Model based development</mark> - [[Models]] are secondary artefacts
	- used for documentation or communication
	- manual analysis and assessment
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Model driven development</mark> - models are primary artefacts
	- models are integral part of the development
	- they are explicitly specified, versioned and developed

- Allows for:
	- better quality, speed and productivity
	- better separation of concerns
	- reusability
	- interoperability and portability

- The holy grail are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">model transformations</mark>, where one model is automaticaly generated from another one
	- used in [[Model Driven Architecture]]
