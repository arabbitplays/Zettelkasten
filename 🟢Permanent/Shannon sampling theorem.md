# Shannon sampling theorem

A continuous, band-limited signal with a maximum frequency $f_{max}$ must be sampled at a frequency <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">greater</mark> than $2f_{max}$ so that the original signal can be reconstructed exactly from the discrete signal

Limiting case at $f_{abtast} = 2f_{max}$
