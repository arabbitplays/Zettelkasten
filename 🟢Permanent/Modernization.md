# Modernization

- Emerged from the industrial revolution 1760-1830 and the French political revolution 1789-1794
- Modernization is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">value-neutral</mark>, i.e. not fundamentally good or bad
	- also not a recipe for progress
- Indicators of a country's relative modernity
	- Population development
	- Life expectancy
	- Mortality and morbidity
	- urbanization
	- technical forms and frequency of communication
	- illiteracy, compulsory education
	- Average income, economic growth, market competition
	- Social security, political participation, democratic form of government
	- Cf. Comparative Welfare States Dataset and Comparative Political Data Set
- Modernization is fundamentally based on democratic party competition and economic competition <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">(competitive democracy)</mark>
	- Requires a functioning constitutional state
- Also requires a conflictual public sphere that lives peaceful <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">pluralism of opinion</mark>
- Much is the affluent society and the welfare state (as well as maximum integration of the population into the labor market)

## Modernization and religion

- No inevitable demystification of religion
- Instead, an ‚Äúinternalization of the world view‚Äù or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">‚Äúindividualization‚Äù</mark>
	- References to external will (God) or uninfluenceable instances such as nature or fate only accepted in very specific contexts (e.g. in the church)
	- Causes of action lie in one's own will or the will of a collective

## Historical views of modernization

- Karl Mark saw material development as decisive
	- Social conflicts are unstable and end in revolutions
	- Overlooks important groups such as the small self-employed
	- Did not consider how well lasting political and economic conflict can be institutionalized and stabilized to drive material progress
- For a long time, the Christian church pushed modernization forward
	- Religious content was organized, clearly formulated and transmitted in writing
	- Basis for a rationalization process that encompassed many areas of life, especially after the Reformation
- Max Weber clearly differentiated modernization as going hand in hand with social ideas and attitudes

## Opponents of modernization

- Countries rich in raw materials often have modernization problems because raw materials are in the hands of established elites
	- They want to maintain the status quo and are threatened by economic and political reforms
- Basic institutions are also at risk as they often take on unpleasant (but indispensable for modernization) roles
- Excessive real or perceived (distributional) inequality can jeopardize modernization
