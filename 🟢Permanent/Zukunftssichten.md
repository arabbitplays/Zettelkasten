# Different views on the future

## Prognostic view of the future

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Technological determinism</mark>
	- Technical development proceeds according to its own laws (invisible hand)
		- Knowledge of the mechanisms could be used for forecasting purposes
	- Nevertheless, allows room for maneuver through arbitrary adaptation to technology and the way society deals with it
- At least partial determinism

## Creative view of the future

- Future is an open space that can be shaped according to certain intentions -> direct consequence of decisions
- Both goal setting and planning thus become very central

## Evolutionary view of the future

- The future is seen as an evolutionary process characterized by variation and selection
- It is not the technical artifacts themselves that evolve, but the way they are created and used
- Here, the future is neither deterministic nor can it be shaped; evolution can only be viewed retrospectively

## Reflection

- In reality, it can be seen that greater differentiation is necessary
	- “even if digitalization can no longer be stopped, how exactly will it be shaped”
- Transparency of the current view of the future is important for the debate
