# Techno-Futures

- Very contradictory perception
	- Ensuring prosperity, increasing comfort, protecting, ...
- Depletion of natural resources, environmental degradation, ethical challenges
- Problems caused by technology should be solved by innovative new technology rather than by renunciation
- Both generate an increase in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">human responsibility</mark> -> ethics a good tool
- needs an object, something that can be discussed -> <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">techno futures</mark>

## Role in society 

- Mediating futures between society and technology
	- Technology shapes society: technology assessment to mitigate or minimize undesirable consequences
	- Society influences technology: also strongly influences the expectations and acceptance of society and decisions on the development and use of technology
- Plurality of futures prevents logical or optimal decisions
- Acting as a medium for social debate on technology

## Definition

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Vision of future developments in which technology plays a recognizable role</mark>

- Includes model-based scenarios, forecasts, visions, roadmaps, science fiction, time diagnoses
- Characterized by today's knowledge, values, assumptions and interests
- Exact implementation very dependent on the [[Views on the future | view on the future]] used
