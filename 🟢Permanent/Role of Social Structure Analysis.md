# Role of Social Structure Analysis

- Social structure describes relationship patterns, class and stratum structures in 3 basic areas:
	- population structure
	- Economy (labor and production)
	- Political system
- Identification of institutional, social and societal boundary conditions
- Scientific evaluation of social and political decisions and processes
	- Are these services effective and efficient?
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Subjective ideas are the micro basis for the macro structure of society</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">In the same way, individual decisions are also guided, influenced and restricted by surrounding structures</mark>

- The aim is objective analysis -> contrast to political conflict, which aims to make collective and binding decisions
	- See also [[role differentiation]]
- Based on scientific methods -> empirical research (surveys, observations, ...)
	- Quantification of concepts such as [[social origin]]

## Scientific work

- Social science and natural science explanations are formally almost identical
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Temporal or social generalization</mark>, however, is limited in many socio-scientific explanatory contexts
	- The statement only applies to this epoch in certain societies

- Nonsensical data/structures - Conditional framework for human action
	- Spectrum of opportunities and restrictions
	- Also intended and unintended results of human action, e.g. the influence of educational classification on chances of success
- <mark style=“background: #FFB86CA6;”>Sense-related structures</mark> - consequences of a causal cause-effect relationship
	- Strongly dependent on the person's rules of experience (culturally formed expectations)
	- Can success be achieved through work or luck? The attitude towards this has an influence on actions and opinion formation
	- Do such <mark style=“background: #D2B3FFA6;”>subjective attributions</mark> occur with regularity and what objective consequences do they have?


<mark style=“background: #FFB86CA6;”>Central questions of social structure analysis:</mark>
- Which subjective causal ideas do people follow?
- What unexpected (side) effects do their actions have
