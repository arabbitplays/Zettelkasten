# Malware Classification

## Introduction

- supervised learned [[Klassifikation | classification]] between two or more classes (benign or malicious data)
	- see [[Malware]] for different types of malicious programs
- we assume that training data exists for both classes and that future attacks a similar to existing ones
- different models
	- [[Neural Networks| (Multi-layer) Perceptrons]] 
	- [[Support Vector Machine (SVM)]]

## How to get the data?

- honeypot - active or passive electronic bait
- forensics - analysis of security incidents 
	- sharing is caring -> there are community services collecting and distributing such data 
- but it is important, that the data is representative -> see [[Common pitfalls in machine learning in IT security]] 

## Attacks against classification models


- Poisoning of learning 
	- see also [[Neural Backdoors]]
	- Careful injection of malicious or benign data
- Mimicry during detection
	- Adaptation of attacks to mimic benign activity
- Red herring
	- Denial-of-service with bogus malicious activity
