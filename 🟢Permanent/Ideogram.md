# Ideogram

- A very abstract linguistic expression that represents a collective commitment to an ambiguous and normative goal
	- Justifies the use of power, excuses behavior and guides behavior and beliefs along socially accepted lines
	- E.g. freedom, property, democracy, privacy
- Exact content of the words is not defined, making ideograms highly adaptable and very broadly functional
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The openness of ideograms makes them so powerful</mark>
	- Are often associated with the meaning of the ideogram in the past <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">(vertical linking)</mark>
		- Central American rebels can either be compared to former rebels under the ideogram “fight for independence” or to terrorists and the ideogram “respect for the law”

## The counter-ideogram

- The position of an ideogram in society can be changed
	- by evaluative comparison with other ideograms <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">(horizontal linking)</mark>
	- by praising and increasing the value of the ideogram
	- or by creating an opposite ideogram and demonizing it
