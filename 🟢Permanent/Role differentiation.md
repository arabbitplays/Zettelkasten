# Role differentiation

- The aim of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">role differentiation</mark> is to separate the citizen from other roles (doctor, parent, scientist, student, ...)
- Freedom of expression is very fundamental to this
	- Countries without this freedom fall back into <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">differentiation</mark>, i.e. the opinion of the head of state (president, king) is accepted as true
- Strong fuel of modernization and progress in prosperity

- Intense conflict shifts discussion from factual issues to the relational dimension (who says what, not what is said)
	- This jeopardizes role differentiation
