# Photometry

## Introduction

- like [[Radiometry]], units that describe light
- every photometric unit has an equivalent radiometric unit
- photometric units describe light like it is perceived by the [[Human Visual System (HVS)]]
	- so the wavelengths are weighted by the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">photopic luminousity function</mark> $\bar{y}(\lambda)$

- for instance, to convert spectral radiant power $\Phi(\lambda)$ to luminous power:
$$\Phi_v = 683.002\ [lm/W]\ \int_\Lambda \bar{y}(\lambda)\Phi(\lambda)d\lambda$$
