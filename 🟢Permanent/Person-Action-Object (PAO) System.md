# Person-Action-Object (PAO) System

- System to convert strings of numbers or playing cards into images through triplets of a person, an action and an object
	- David Beckham kicking a soccerball (00)
	- Superman flying with a cape (23)
	- Frank Sinatra playing the trumpet (76)
- For example, every number $00 - 99$ gets a triplet
- 6 numbers (three triplets) can than be interspersed by combining the person of the first two, the action of the second two and the object of the last two
	- David Beckham flying on a trumpet (002376)
- These images can then be stored in a [[Memory Palace]]
