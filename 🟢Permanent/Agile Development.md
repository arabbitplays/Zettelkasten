- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">product backlog</mark> is a high level list of features and known requirements for the project, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">sprint backlog</mark> is the todo list of activities for the current sprint
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Product Owner</mark>
	- represents customer interest
	- helps clarify questions and makes sure, that the right features are implemented
		- changes features and priorities before sprints
	- release management
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Scrum Master</mark>
	- responsible for the process and solves problems for the team
	- manage dependencies in the team, buffer conflicts, and support communication
	- secures commitment to Scrum principles
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Team</mark>
	- Self organized,
	- implements the product increment
	- estimates the backlog items
- plan a sprint so that 85% of the capacity of the team for the spring is used (calibrated for each organization not exactly this number)

- scrum for large projects
	- grow slowly, only splitting a team every 2-3 sprints
	- minimize dependencies between the teams
	- daily scrum of scrums with representatives of the teams
- scrum for distributed projects
	- personal communication is very important, so this should be avoided
	- have core team which members can become nuclei for distributed teams

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">problems of scrum</mark>
	- some architecture decisions are by nature hard to reverse
	- scaling is unclear
	- high responsibility for individual team members -> not everyone wants this pressure
