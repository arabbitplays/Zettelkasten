The Zettelkasten is a note taking approach, acknowledging that notes are only valuable in their context. So the system tries to build an endless scaling web of references, where every note is directly embedded into their appropriate contexts.

The system defies three types of notes:
- fleeting notes - just everything written down, unorganized and quick
- literary notes - most important points, with bibliography
- permanent notes - to be added in the Zettelkasten


It is important to check fleeting and literary notes in regular intervals (for example at the end of the day) to transition them into more organised and worked out states, while still having the important content in mind.

The notes are then structured into an ever branching tree, where one branch represent a theme and every subsequent note is another source or another idea, adding to the theme. The notes can also have links in between each other.

Indices can be used to give an overview over a bigger group of note, but the system explicitly avoids growing hierarchical structures, as they scale badly.
