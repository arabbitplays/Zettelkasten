# Social Origin


- Factors: Education, income and wealth, occupation, family structure
- determines many things such as relationships, own profession, view of the world
	- even the will to improve oneself, to research, to communicate comes from the social background
- Restricts all areas of life to a certain extent
	- Idealism makes you sad because it builds up expectations beyond this level (always happy relationships, wealth, ...)

How powerful am I in this environment?
