# Distributed Memory Multiprocessor

## Introduction

- no common memory or address space
- communication over messages sent over [[Connection Networks]] (see [[Network Topology]])
- It can basically scale indefinitely, only capped by the connection network
- basic architecture for super computers

## Structure

- each computation node consists of one processor or even a [[Uniform Memory Architecture (UMA)]]
	- has its own local memory $M$ 
	- is naturally asynchronous
