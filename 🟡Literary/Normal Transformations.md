# Normal Transformations

## Transforming with Model Matrix

- when scaling non-uniformly the normal is not perpendicular to the surface anymore
- transform with the inverse of the transpose of the Model matrix instead
	- makes no difference for Translation (not important with normals) and Rotation (inverse = transpose)

## Transforming Normal Maps

- Normal Maps usually are given in [[Tangentspace]]
- The z-axis is up
